# Higgsfield Repurpose — Shorts, Clips, and Analysis of Finished Video

## QUICK FACTS
*Routing aids — read the linked sections for the full rules. Nothing in this sub-skill is field-tested.*
- Four surfaces take a video that already exists: Shorts Studio (restyle → shorts), Clipify (YouTube → subtitled clips), Virality Predictor (a score), Video Analysis (a scene breakdown) [→](#what-this-sub-skill-is-for)
- Paid vs free is per tool — `shorts_studio_create` is **PAID**; its `get_cost` estimate and preset creation state they are free; list / status calls state no cost [→](#paid-or-free--read-this-before-calling-anything)
- Shorts Studio: source 4–120s, output **720p only**, 9:16 default (16:9 optional); preflight with `get_cost: true` + `duration_seconds` — no preset or upload needed for the estimate [→](#shorts-studio)
- Shorts Studio presets store a STYLE (≤10 media, videos ≤30s, public https URLs) — write the preset prompt as laws, not adjectives [→](#style-presets-free)
- Clipify: exactly ONE YouTube URL per job; 1–20 clips; 9:16 / 1:1 / 16:9; subtitle font, case, position and highlight colour are parameters [→](#clipify)
- Virality Predictor: input is a confirmed uploaded video or a completed generated video; it is a PREDICTION — compare variants with it, don't treat it as audience data [→](#virality-predictor)
- Video Analysis: exactly one of uploaded video / YouTube URL; ~3–5 min; **warn up front: the longer the video, the less accurate the breakdown** [→](#video-analysis)
- Burned-in captions, cuts, soundtrack, voice swaps are other surfaces — hand-off map [→](#where-the-neighbouring-jobs-live)

## What this sub-skill is for

Every surface here starts from a **video that already exists** — a finished ad, a long
YouTube video, a generated clip — and produces something derived from it: restyled
shorts, cut-down clips, a performance prediction, or a scene list. None of them writes a
generation prompt from scratch; that is the rest of this library.

| Surface | Input | Output | Tool / model |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Shorts Studio** | One uploaded video, 4–120s + a style preset | A set of AI-restyled short-form clips | `shorts_studio_*` (MCP) |
| **Clipify** | One YouTube URL | Ready-to-share clips with subtitles | `clipify` (video catalog model) |
| **Virality Predictor** | An uploaded or generated video | Virality / engagement / attention / hook / retention-risk prediction + dashboard | `virality_predictor` (MCP) |
| **Video Analysis** | An uploaded video or a YouTube URL | Scene-by-scene analysis | `video_analysis_*` (MCP) |

**Not this sub-skill:** changing what is *inside* a clip (swap an object, re-light, extend
it) — that is `../higgsfield-seedance-2-5/SKILL.md` (video_edit / video_extension),
`../higgsfield-seedance-vfx/SKILL.md`, or Genjutsu (`../higgsfield-marketing-studio/SKILL.md`
§ 14). Many edited versions of one ad → Ad Multiplier, same § 14.

## Paid or free — read this before calling anything

`[OFFICIAL — Higgsfield MCP tool schema, 2026-09-26]` unless marked.

| Tool | Spends credits? | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `shorts_studio_create` | **PAID** — "reserves credits" | Tool description |
| `shorts_studio_create` with `get_cost: true` + `duration_seconds` | **Free** — "estimate the credit cost without submitting a job"; no preset or source video needed | Tool description |
| `shorts_studio_create_preset` | **Free** — "just stores a STYLE — no generation, no credits" | Tool description |
| `shorts_studio_list_presets` · `shorts_studio_list_sessions` · `shorts_studio_status` | **Not stated** — list / status calls that submit nothing; not called free here | Tool descriptions (silent on cost) |
| `clipify` | **Not stated.** It is a video-catalog model, so it runs through `generate_video` / the CLI and can be preflighted with `get_cost: true` (MCP) or `higgsfield generate cost clipify …` (CLI — confirm the flag form with `higgsfield model get clipify` first) | `[OFFICIAL — platform, 2026-09-26]` snapshot has no price field |
| `virality_predictor` | **Not stated**, and the tool has no `get_cost` field | Tool schema |
| `video_analysis_create` | **Not stated**, and the tool has no `get_cost` field | Tool schema |
| `video_analysis_status` · `video_analysis_jobs` | **Not stated** — status / list calls that submit nothing; not called free here | Tool descriptions (silent on cost) |

**Where the schema is silent, do not call it free.** Check the balance before and after
(`balance` / `transactions` on MCP, `higgsfield account status` on the CLI) the first time
a surface is used, and record what it actually cost. No prices appear in this file because
none were measured.

## Shorts Studio

`[OFFICIAL — Higgsfield MCP tool schema, shorts_studio_*, 2026-09-26]`

> "Start a Shorts Studio short: restyle one uploaded source video (4s–120s) into a set of
> AI-generated short-form clips using a style preset. PAID — reserves credits."

| Param | Values | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `source_video_id` | uuid | The uploaded video's `video_input` id (`media_upload_widget`, type=video). Required unless `get_cost` |
| `preset_id` | uuid | From `shorts_studio_list_presets` or `shorts_studio_create_preset`. Required unless `get_cost` |
| `preset_source` | `user` · `cms` | The preset item's own `preset_source`. Required unless `get_cost` |
| `aspect_ratio` | `9:16` (default) · `16:9` | Output orientation |
| `resolution` | `720p` | **The only value** — the schema pins it as a constant |
| `get_cost` | bool | With `duration_seconds`, returns the estimate and submits nothing |
| `duration_seconds` | > 0, ≤ 120 | Source length; required when `get_cost` is true |

**The run, in order:**

1. **Estimate first** — `get_cost: true` + `duration_seconds` (free; no preset, no upload).
2. **Pick or make a style** — `shorts_studio_list_presets` returns the user's own presets
   first, then the CMS library (paginated via `next_cursor`); or make one (below).
3. **Upload the source** — the user uploads through `media_upload_widget` (type=video);
   the tool asks for an upload before it is called, never a chat attachment.
4. **Create** — PAID. Returns a session with **empty** `job_ids`.
5. **Poll** `shorts_studio_status` until clips appear. `status='completed'` means every
   clip job is *terminal*, **not necessarily successful** — check each clip.

> **Schema mismatch to know about:** `shorts_studio_status` says to poll each clip's
> `job_id` "via job_status", but no `job_status` tool is in the connector's 2026-09-26 tool
> list — the listed job tools are `jobs_wait`, `job_display` and `show_generation_by_ids`.
> Which one the status tool means is unverified.

**Not published:** how many clips a session produces, how long each is, and what the
restyle keeps from the source (timing, audio, framing). Look at one real session before
promising any of them.

### Style presets (free)

`shorts_studio_create_preset` stores a style from reference media — no generation, no
credits.

- **Limits:** ≤ 10 media total; each video ≤ 30s (send `duration` so the cap applies);
  every media item a **public https URL** (use an uploaded media's URL, or
  `media_import_url` first).
- **Fields:** `name` (required), `prompt` (optional style direction), `image_medias`,
  `video_medias`, `thumbnail`.
- **Naming:** Higgsfield's own tool instruction is to give an unnamed preset a random
  friendly two-word name rather than ask — follow it.
- **What this library adds** `[INFERENCE — untested]`: a style preset is a *saved style
  block*, the same job as Cinema Studio's Manual Style — so write its `prompt` the same
  way: **laws, not descriptions** (grade behaviour, lighting law, texture, camera register),
  no vague labels, no director name-drops. See `../higgsfield-cinema/SKILL.md` § Manual
  Style — Authoring Guide.

## Clipify

`[OFFICIAL — platform, 2026-09-26]` — model `clipify`, "Turn one YouTube video into
ready-to-share clips with subtitles" (video catalog, `../../specs/models_explore_snapshot_2026-09-26.json`).

| Param | Values | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `urls` | YouTube URL array — "Provide **exactly one** URL; submit one Clipify job per source video" | required |
| `clips_num` | 1–20 | 10 |
| `clip_aspect` | `9:16` · `1:1` · `16:9` | `9:16` |
| `subtitle_font` | `notosans` · `notoserif` · `notosansdisplay` · `ibmplexsans` · `mplusrounded1c` · `bebasneue` · `archivoblack` · `unbounded` · `inter` · `montserrat` · `bangers` · `permanentmarker` · `playfairdisplay` · `caveat` | `notosans` |
| `subtitle_case` | `upper` · `lower` · `as-is` | `as-is` |
| `subtitle_position` | `bottom` · `center` · `top` | `bottom` |
| `subtitle_highlight_hex` | `#RRGGBB` | `#FFE84D` |
| `track_face_crop` | bool — "Track faces when cropping clips" | true |
| `max_height` | 144–2160 — "Maximum source processing height" | 1080 |
| `segment_seconds` | 2–60 — "Segment duration in seconds" | 10 |

**Clipify vs Shorts Studio.** Clipify **cuts** one YouTube video into subtitled clips; it
has no style or restyle parameter. Shorts Studio **restyles** one uploaded video into
AI-generated clips from a preset. Long talk / podcast / tutorial → clips: Clipify. A
short piece whose look should change: Shorts Studio.

The source is fetched from YouTube — clip only videos the user owns or has the rights to.
What `segment_seconds` controls beyond its one-line description is not documented.

## Virality Predictor

`[OFFICIAL — Higgsfield MCP tool schema, virality_predictor, 2026-09-26]`

> "predicts a video's virality potential, engagement, attention, audience response,
> retention risk, hook strength, and creative performance with an interactive dashboard."

- `action: "create"` with `params.medias: [{role: "video", id: <uuid>}]` — the id is a
  **confirmed uploaded video `media_id`** or a **completed generated video `job_id`**;
  `params.model` is the constant `"virality_predictor"`.
- `action: "preview"` with `params.job_id` re-opens an existing dashboard.
- **CLI face:** Higgsfield's own skills repo says its Virality Predictor path "Uses
  Virality Predictor (`brain_activity`) with `--video`" `[OFFICIAL — Higgsfield skills repo
  README, v0.12.0]`; CLI 1.1.23 `model get brain_activity` shows a text-output model named
  "Brain Activity" that requires `medias`. That the two are the same product rests on that
  README line — not verified here.

**How this library uses it** `[INFERENCE — untested]`:

- **It is a prediction, not audience data.** This repo has never compared its scores with
  real performance. Report it as "the predictor says", never as "this will go viral".
- **Compare variants, don't chase a number.** The useful question is relative: hook A vs
  hook B on the *same* ad, cut 1 vs cut 2. Rewriting a creative only to move one score is
  optimizing the instrument.
- Natural pairings: hook variants from `../higgsfield-marketing-studio/SKILL.md`, Ad
  Multiplier versions (same skill, § 14), campaign batches in
  `../higgsfield-content-factory/SKILL.md`.

## Video Analysis

`[OFFICIAL — Higgsfield MCP tool schema, video_analysis_*, 2026-09-26]`

- **Input — exactly one of:** `video_input_id` (an uploaded video's media id) **or**
  `youtube_url` (https on `youtube.com`, `www.youtube.com`, `m.youtube.com` or `youtu.be`
  only).
- **Queued:** returns `status='queued'`; poll `video_analysis_status` every 30–60 seconds
  until `completed` (scenes populated) or `failed` (`fail_reason` populated). "Processing
  typically takes 3-5 minutes on average." Past jobs: `video_analysis_jobs`.
- **The warning the tool requires, verbatim:** *"warn the user up front that the longer
  the video, the less accurate the scene-by-scene analysis becomes — short clips give the
  most reliable results."* Say it **before** submitting, every time.
- Practical consequence: trim to the sequence you actually care about before uploading.

**Uses in this repo** `[HYPOTHESIS — UNMEASURED]`:

- **Reference breakdown** — a short reference sequence → a scene list to seed
  `../higgsfield-shotlist-director/SKILL.md` or to audit with
  `../higgsfield-scene-engine/SKILL.md`. Analyze a reference for its *structure*; the
  shotlist still gets written, not copied.
- **Cut check** — did a generated multi-shot clip actually cut where the prompt declared
  ("strictly N shots")? The analysis is a second pair of eyes, not a verdict.
- The output's shape beyond "scenes" is not documented. Treat what comes back as notes to
  verify against the video, never as ground truth.
